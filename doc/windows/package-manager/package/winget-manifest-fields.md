# Creating a Manifest

If you want to submit a software package to the [Windows Package Manager Community Repository](repository.md), you will need to [create a package manifest](manifest.md). Each YAML file within the manifest has different metadata fields that can be added to the manifest. It is best to fill out as much metadata as possible, even if the Windows Package Manager client (winget.exe) does not fully support it yet.

## Manifest Fields

### [Singleton Manifest](#tab/singleton/)

### [Installer Manifest](#tab/installer/)

### [Default Locale Manifest](#tab/defaultLocale/)

### [Additional Locale Manifest](#tab/locale/)

### [Version Manifest](#tab/version/)
